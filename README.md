# Lulzbot Taz Pro Enclosure

An open-source smart enclosure designed for the Lulzbot Taz Pro made to cost under $150CAD (\~$105USD), featuring a particle filtration and camera system, each costing under $50CAD (\~$35USD).

This was originally designed for [Western University's Free Appropriate Sustainability Technology (FAST) Lab.](https://www.appropedia.org/FAST) But effort has been made in the open sourcing of this project towards the ease of replication. 

The materials used to build this enclosure can be found globally online and at hardware stores.
